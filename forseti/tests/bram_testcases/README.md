Bram van Heuveln Handouts
==========================

This folder contains a series of proofs ranging from the propositional logic, to the predicate logic, and finishing
with the first order logic. These problems come from handouts that were given within Professor Bram van Heuveln's
PHIL4140 and PHIL4420 courses. We use these to provide a baseline for the forseti ATP to show that if it can solve
all of these problems correctly, then that it is, for all intents and purposes, a successful FOL ATP and could,
given enough time, solve any such problem (or one of a lower order).

The handouts, in order of difficulty in given arguments and for ATP testing: 
* [Propositional Logic Proofs](handouts/PropLogicProofs.pdf)  
* [Propositional Logic Proofs II](handouts/PropLogicProofsII.pdf)  
* [Propositional Logic Arguments](handouts/PropLogicArguments.pdf)
* [Propositional Logic Arguments II](handouts/PropLogicArgumentsII.pdf)
* [Predicate Logic Arguments](handouts/PredicateLogicArguments.pdf)
* [First Order Logic Proofs](handouts/FOLProofsII.pdf)
